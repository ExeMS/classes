         <h1> Theory:</h1>
		 
		 Charles’ law states that for a constant amount of gas, the volume is proportional to the absolute temperature if
the pressure remains constant.
$$V \propto T \text{ for constant }P$$
A plot of volume versus Centigrade temperature intercepts the x-axis at -273 oC which suggests that the gas would occupy no volume at this temperature. This theoretical value is known as absolute zero, and is also
known as 0 Kelvin.
		 

	<h1> Apparatus 1:</h1>
<ul>	
<li>Thermometer </li>
<li>Scale/ruler</li>
<li>Water </li>
<li>Sulfuric acid</li>
<li>Heat source </li>
<li>Length of trapped air</li>
</ul>
   

<h1>Experimental Method 1:</h1>

Heat the water using a Bunsen burner and stir regularly. Measure the length
of the trapped air every 10 C up to 80 C. Plot a graph of the length of
trapped air (y-axis) against temperature (x-axis). The temperature scale
should cover the range -400 C to 100 C. The length scale should start at
zero. <br> 
Draw a line of best fit extended back until it cuts the x-axis, this is
absolute zero.

The apparatus should be set up as shown. <br>

	<h1> Apparatus 2:</h1>
<ul>	
<li>Thermometer </li>
<li>Scale/ruler</li>
<li>Water </li>
<li>Sulfuric acid</li>
<li>Heat source </li>
<li>Length of trapped air</li>
</ul>
<h1> Alternative Experimental Method:</h1>
<br>
Obtain five 400-mL beakers and label them #1–5. Prepare water baths at different temperatures as follows:
•Add crushed ice and water (total volume 250 mL), followed by 5–6 scoop-fulls of salt to beaker #1 to prepare a bath at
a temperature between –10 °C and –15 °C.
•Add crushed ice and water to beaker #2 to prepare a 0 °C-bath.
•Add 250 mL of room temperature water to beaker #3 to prepare a 20 °C-bath.
•Add 250 mL of hot running water to beaker #4 to prepare a 40–50 °C-bath.
Add 250 mL of water to beaker #5 and heat it on a hot plate at a medium setting to prepare a hot water bath at about
80 °C.
2. Add hot water or ice as needed during the course of the experiment to maintain the temperature of each bath within ±5 °C
of the desired temperature.
3. Obtain one small and one large syringe. Lubricate the plunger of each syringe with silicone grease. Wearing gloves, apply
a dab of grease to the black rubber gasket and use a wooden splint or tongue dispenser to spread a thin layer of grease over
the surface of the gasket.
4. Fill one syringe about ½-full with air and seal the syringe with a syringe tip cap.
5. Fill the second syringe with a different gas. Attach the syringe tip to a gas source, turn on the gas source, and pull on the
plunger to fill the syringe completely with the gas. Disconnect the syringe from the gas source, push on the syringe to expel
the gas, then reattach the syringe to the gas source and fill the syringe about ½-full again. Seal the syringe with a syringe tip
cap and record the identity of the gas (hydrogen, helium, etc.).
6. Measure and record the temperature of the coldest water bath (beaker #1). Place the first syringe
in the bath and submerge the syringe just up to the bottom of the plunger (see Figure 1). Hold it
there for two minutes, then quickly push down on the plunger once and release it.
7. Measure and record the volume when the plunger stops moving. Note: Keep the syringe in the
water bath the entire time.
8. Remove the syringe from the first bath and place it in the second temperature bath. Repeat steps
7 and 8 to measure the new temperature and volume of the gas.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 at the remaining water-bath temperatures to obtain a total of five different
temperature–pressure readings.
10. Repeat steps 7–10 with the second syringe filled with a different gas.


<h2> Extension: </h2>
A series of cards of different diameters could be included to investigate the effect of different surface area on
damping (the cards could be placed on top of the different masses).<br>

Note that displacement sensors could be used to obtain data digitally <br>

<br>


<h1>Further guidance</h1>

Use appropriate analogue apparatus to record a range of measurements (to include length/distance, temperature, pressure, force, angles, volume) and to interpolate between scale markings.
<ul>
<li> Use calipers and micrometers for small distances, using digital or vernier scales.</li>
<li> Use ICT such as computer modelling, or data logger with a variety of sensors to collect data, or use of software to process data.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Results</h1>
Make sure you record your method and results clearly.
