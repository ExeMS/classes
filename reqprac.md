# Required practicalals
## In general, you should be able to:

* apply investigative approaches and methods to practical work and think independently when undertaking practical work;
* use a wide range 
of experimental and practical instruments, equipment and techniques appropriate to the knowledge and understanding included in the specification.
## Methods of data collection and analysis
You should be able to:
* describe with the aid of a clearly labelled diagram, the arrangement of apparatus for the experiment and the procedures to be followed;
* describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion, including details of derived quantities and graphs to be drawn where appropriate;
* select appropriate apparatus and record the instrument resolution used i.e. the smallest measurable division on the instrument;
* set up apparatus correctly without assistance and follow instructions given in the form of written instructions, diagrams or circuit diagrams;
* undertake and record trial readings to determine the suitability of ranges and intervals;
* take repeat readings where appropriate;
* make and record accurate measurements;
* evaluate experimental methods and suggest improvements.

## Safety Considerations

You should be able to:

* assess the risks of your experiment; 

|-| - | - |
| Hazard | Risk | Control Measure |
|-| - | - |
| an object or chemical and the nature of the hazard | an object or chemical and the nature of the hazard | must be practicable in the context of the practical |
|-| - | - |

* describe precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum.

## Recording readings and significant figures
All raw data should be recorded to the resolution of the instrument used. Any data processed (calculated) from the raw data should be to the same number of significant figures (or a maximum of one extra) as the raw data. The number of significant figures should be consistent within a column of data.
To simplify things a general rule is that:
Processed data should be given to the same number of significant figures as raw data and raw data should always be quoted to the resolution of the instrument used to measure it.

## Approach to data analysis
You should be able to:
* rearrange expressions into the form $ 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 + 𝑐 $;
* plot a graph of y against x and use the graph to find constants $m$ and $c$ in an equation in the form $ 𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 + 𝑐 $.
* rearrange expressions into the forms: $ y = ax^{n} $ and $ y = ae^{kx}$;
* plot a graph of log y against log x and use the graph to find the constants a and n in an equation in the form $𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥^{n}$ ;
* plot a graph of $\ln y$ against $x$ and use the graph to find the constants a and k in an equation of the form $𝑦 = 𝑎𝑒^{kx}$.

## Graphs
You should be able to:
* include a title and axes which are labelled with scales and units;
* make sure the scales are convenient to use, so that readings may easily be taken from the graph – avoid scales which use factors of 3 – and that the plotted points occupy at least half of both the vertical and horizontal extent of the graph grid;
* first consider carefully whether your plotted points suggest a straight line or a curve - then draw in your best fit line either with the aid of a ruler or (if a curve) by a freehand sketch;
* when extracting data from a graph, use the best-fit line rather than the original data;
* when determining the gradient of a graph, show clearly on your graph the readings you use. This is most conveniently done by drawing a right angled triangle – this should be large so that accuracy is preserved.

### Error bars
The points should be plotted with error bars. These should be centred on the plotted point and have a total length equal to $y_{max}- y_{min}, for uncertainties in the $y$ values of the points, and $x_{max} – x_{min}$, for uncertainties in the $x$ values of the points. If identical results are obtained the precision of the instrument could be used. If the error bars are too small to plot this should be stated. This will almost certainly be the case for log graphs.

### Maximum and minimum gradients
If calculating a quantity such as the gradient or the intercept a line of maximum gradient and a line of minimum gradient should be drawn which are consistent with the error bars. It is often convenient to plot the centroid of the points to help this process. This is the point,$(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ the
mean $x$ value against the mean $y$ value. The line of maximum gradient and the line of minimum gradient should both pass through this point.
Values for the maximum and minimum gradients, $m_{max}$ and $m_{min}$, [or intercepts, $c_{max}$ and $c_{min}$]
can now be found and the results quoted as:
$$ \text{gradient} = \frac{m_{max}+m_{min}}{2} \pm \frac{m_{max}-m_{min}}{2}$$
$$ \text{intercept} = \frac{c_{max}+c_{min}}{2} \pm \frac{c_{max}-c_{min}}{2}$$

### The following remarks apply to curved graphs;
If the graph is curved error bars should still be plotted (on both axes if possible) and a curve of
best fit drawn to enable a tangent to be constructed if the gradient of any point is needed.
