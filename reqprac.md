# Required practicalals
## In general, you should be able to:

* apply investigative approaches and methods to practical work and think independently when undertaking practical work;
* use a wide range 
of experimental and practical instruments, equipment and techniques appropriate to the knowledge and understanding included in the specification.
## Methods of data collection and analysis
You should be able to:
* describe with the aid of a clearly labelled diagram, the arrangement of apparatus for the experiment and the procedures to be followed;
* describe how the data should be used in order to reach a conclusion, including details of derived quantities and graphs to be drawn where appropriate;
* select appropriate apparatus and record the instrument resolution used i.e. the smallest measurable division on the instrument;
* set up apparatus correctly without assistance and follow instructions given in the form of written instructions, diagrams or circuit diagrams;
* undertake and record trial readings to determine the suitability of ranges and intervals;
* take repeat readings where appropriate;
* make and record accurate measurements;
* evaluate experimental methods and suggest improvements.

## Safety Considerations

You should be able to:

*assess the risks of your experiment; 
---
| Hazard | Risk | Control Measure |
---
| an object or chemical and the nature of the hazard | an object or chemical and the nature of the hazard | must be practicable in the context of the practical |
---
* describe precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum.

## Recording readings and significant figures
All raw data should be recorded to the resolution of the instrument used. Any data processed (calculated) from the raw data should be to the same number of significant figures (or a maximum of one extra) as the raw data. The number of significant figures should be consistent within a column of data.
To simplify things a general rule is that:
Processed data should be given to the same number of significant figures as raw data and raw data should always be quoted to the resolution of the instrument used to measure it.

## Approach to data analysis
You should be able to:
You should be able to:
* rearrange expressions into the form \(𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 + 𝑐\);
* plot a graph of y against x and use the graph to find constants m and c in an equation in the form \(𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 + 𝑐\).
* rearrange expressions into the forms: \(y = ax^{n} \) and \(y = ae^{kx};
 plot a graph of log y against log x and use the graph to find the constants a and n in an
equation in the form 𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥
𝑛
;
 plot a graph of ln y against x and use the graph to find the constants a and k in an
equation of the form 𝑦 = 𝑎𝑒
𝑘𝑥
.
